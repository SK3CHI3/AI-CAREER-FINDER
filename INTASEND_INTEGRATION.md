# IntaSend Payment Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of IntaSend Payment Button Element for the AI Career Finder application, requiring users to pay KSh 1,000 before accessing the full platform.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Added payment-related fields to the `profiles` table:
- `payment_status`: 'pending', 'completed', 'failed', 'refunded'
- `payment_reference`: Internal tracking reference
- `payment_date`: Timestamp of successful payment
- `payment_amount`: Payment amount (1000.00)
- `payment_currency`: Currency (KES)
- `intasend_transaction_id`: IntaSend transaction ID

### 2. Components Created

#### PaymentWall Component
- Displays payment form with IntaSend button
- Handles payment success/failure states
- Updates user profile with payment details
- Redirects to dashboard after successful payment

#### PaymentGate Component
- Wraps the main application
- Checks profile completion status
- Checks payment status
- Shows appropriate screen based on user state

### 3. User Flow

```
Registration → Profile Setup → Payment Wall → Full Access
     ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓
   Sign Up → Complete Profile → Pay KSh 1,000 → Dashboard
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
VITE_INTASEND_PUBLIC_KEY=your_intasend_public_key_here
VITE_INTASEND_LIVE=false  # Set to true for production
```

### 5. IntaSend Configuration

#### Test Environment
- Use sandbox key from https://sandbox.intasend.com/
- No sign-up required for testing
- Test with sandbox payment methods

#### Production Environment
- Get live API key from IntaSend dashboard
- Set `VITE_INTASEND_LIVE=true`
- Configure webhook endpoints for payment notifications

### 6. Payment Button Features

The payment button includes:
- Amount: KSh 1,000 (fixed)
- Currency: KES
- Customer details pre-filled from profile
- All payment methods enabled (M-Pesa, Cards, etc.)
- Business pays all charges
- Custom reference for tracking

### 7. Security Considerations

- Payment status stored in database
- IntaSend handles sensitive payment data
- No card details stored locally
- Payment verification through IntaSend webhooks

### 8. Testing

#### Test Payment Methods
- M-Pesa: Use test phone numbers
- Cards: Use test card numbers from IntaSend docs
- Verify payment status updates correctly

#### Test Scenarios
1. Complete profile → Payment wall appears
2. Successful payment → Dashboard access granted
3. Failed payment → Retry option available
4. Payment processing → Loading state shown

### 9. Error Handling

- Payment failure: Show retry button
- Network errors: Graceful fallback
- Invalid API key: Clear error message
- Payment timeout: Retry mechanism

### 10. Monitoring

- Track payment success/failure rates
- Monitor payment processing times
- Log payment events for debugging
- Set up alerts for payment failures
