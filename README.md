# CareerPath AI - Your CBE Career Guide 

## My Story

When I was in primary class 8, transitioning to high school, I faced a crucial decision point in my academic journey. Without proper guidance or someone to turn to for career advice, I made choices that would impact my future path. I dropped physics - a decision I later regretted when I discovered my passion for software engineering. This personal experience highlighted a critical gap in our education system: the lack of proper career guidance at pivotal moments.

This is why I created CareerPath AI - to ensure no student has to navigate Kenya''s complex Competency-Based Education (CBE) curriculum blindly.
